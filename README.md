Hello guys!👋
I'm new to Python and I'm currently learning it.

Here are some of my Python problems that I've solved (They are from Hackerrank and my institute's OJ platform).
I've learned some C++ before, so some of them may look like they're just translated from C++ to Python.

I'm trying to write code as Pythonic as possible, so if you have any suggestions or feedbacks, feel free to open an Issue, I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks a lot!🙌
